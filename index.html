            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              The Algorithm is a vibrant student-founded and student-led tech community at
              Padma Kanya Campus, dedicated to leveraging technology for the
              betterment of society and gender equality. We recognize that representation of females
              in STEM is very low, primarily due to a lack of instilled
              confidence, access to learning STEM concepts, role models, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              One common sentiment among the females in our university is that we
              are limiting ourselves due to a lack of confidence and imposter
              syndrome. Therefore, The Algorithm community focuses on helping
              females build confidence through hands-on experience and mentorship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Senior year university students organize workshops and events for
              junior year students. As the junior students gain knowledge, the
              senior students, serving as organizers or mentors, also gain
              confidence by exposing themselves to leadership roles. In the past
              10 months, our community has expanded beyond its initial scope.
              Initially, we had 8 executive members, but now we have added 3 more
              to our board. Additionally, we have positively impacted over 500
              women through our events, workshops, and projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of our significant milestones is being included in the Women in
              Data Steering Committee by The Asia Foundation, where we work on
              dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a more equitable future
              for women in the data and technology landscape. Currently, we are
              focusing on open data and how it can be leveraged to make
              data-driven policies. To this end, we are organizing hackathons
              outside the capital city, focusing on these themes. Together, we
              pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive tomorrow.

          <section id="shared-struggles" class="fade-in">
            <h2>What We Address</h2>
            <p>
              Our community addresses the common challenges faced by women in technology 
              and provides support to overcome these barriers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lack of Confidence and Imposter Syndrome</strong>
                Many of us struggle with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, which can limit
                our potential. We create safe spaces for learning and growth where members
                can practice skills and build confidence without judgment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Leadership Skills Development</strong>
                We provide opportunities to practice and develop leadership skills through
                organizing events, workshops, and community initiatives. Every member gets
                a chance to lead and make meaningful contributions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Professional Experience and Resume Building</strong>
                Gaining volunteering experience is important to us, as it helps in securing internships
                and building our resumes with real-world impact. Our initiatives provide
                tangible experience that employers value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mentoring and Supporting Newcomers</strong>
                We are passionate about supporting and mentoring newcomers in the tech field,
                creating a welcoming environment for all skill levels. Our peer-to-peer
                mentorship model ensures everyone feels supported.

          <!-- Election Process Section -->
          <section id="election-process" class="fade-in">
            <h2>Our Democratic Election Process</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in transparent and fair leadership transitions. Our election process 
              ensures that every voice is heard and respected:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Announcement & Nominations</strong>
                The process begins with an official announcement inviting junior committee members 
                to nominate themselves for leadership roles. Interested candidates must submit a 
                nomination form that outlines their qualifications, relevant experience, and vision 
                for their desired role. This ensures all candidates have a clear understanding of 
                their potential responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Campaigning Period</strong>
                Approved candidates are given a dedicated period to campaign within the community. 
                This allows them to share their goals, proposed initiatives, and vision for their role. 
                Campaigning may include "Meet the Candidates" sessions, presentations, and discussions 
                to engage and inform the community, fostering transparency and trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fair Voting Process</strong>
                The community conducts voting through a secret ballot process to maintain fairness 
                and confidentiality. Voting is open to all eligible members (e.g., junior and senior 
                committees) and can be facilitated in-person or through a secure online platform. 
                This ensures everyone has an equal opportunity to voice their choice for the incoming leaders.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Results & Leadership Handover</strong>
                Once votes are counted and verified, the results are announced in a formal manner. 
                A handover ceremony is held to celebrate the transition of leadership. Outgoing leaders 
                provide mentorship and guidance to the incoming members, ensuring they are well-prepared 
                for their new roles and responsibilities, fostering continuity and growth within the community.

          <!-- Mission Section -->
          <section id="mission" class="fade-in">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Our community's mission is to build an ecosystem within the campus
              where everyone feels welcome to practice their leadership skills.
              The heart of our community is that senior year students organize
              workshops for junior year students. This approach allows senior
              students to lead events, boosting their confidence, while junior
              students benefit from the knowledge and experience of their seniors.
              An additional benefit for senior year students is that these
              leadership experiences enhance their resumes, making it easier to
              secure internships and career opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We envision a future where every woman in technology feels empowered, 
              confident, and supported in her journey. Through our initiatives, we aim to 
              create lasting change not just within our campus, but in the broader tech 
              ecosystem of Nepal. Our goal is to become a model for other institutions
              and inspire similar communities across the region.
