          <h2>Community Definition</h2>
          <p>
            The Algorithm, a student-founded and student-led tech community at
            Padma Kanya Campus, is dedicated to leveraging technology for the
            betterment of society and gender equality. Representation of females
            in STEM is very low, primarily due to a lack of instilled
            confidence, access to learning STEM concepts, role models, and more.
            One common sentiment among the females in my university is that we
            are limiting ourselves due to a lack of confidence and imposter
            syndrome. Therefore, The Algorithm community focuses on helping
            females build confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senior year university students organize workshops and events for
            junior year students. As the junior students gain knowledge, the
            senior students, serving as organizers or mentors, also gain
            confidence by exposing themselves to leadership roles. In the past
            10 months, our community has expanded beyond its initial scope.
            Initially, we had 8 executive members, but now we have added 3 more
            to our board. Additionally, we have positively impacted over 500
            women through our events, workshops, and projects. We have expanded
            our reach by collaborating with prominent organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our significant milestones is being included in the Women in
            Data Steering Committee by The Asia Foundation, where we work on
            dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a more equitable future
            for women in the data and technology landscape. Currently, we are
            focusing on open data and how it can be leveraged to make
            data-driven policies. To this end, we are organizing hackathons
            outside the capital city, focusing on these themes. Together, we
            pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive tomorrow.

          <h2>Shared Struggles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of Confidence and Imposter Syndrome:</strong> Many of
              us struggle with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, which can limit
              our potential.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Desire for Leadership Skills:</strong> We seek
              opportunities to practice and develop our leadership skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Volunteering Experience:</strong> Gaining volunteering
              experience is important to us, as it helps in securing internships
              and building our resumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Helping Newbies in Tech:</strong> We are passionate about
              supporting and mentoring newcomers in the tech field.

        <section id="election-process">
          <h2>Election Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Announcement & Nominations:</strong> The process begins with an official announcement inviting junior committee members to nominate themselves for leadership roles. Interested candidates must submit a nomination form that outlines their qualifications, relevant experience, and vision for their desired role. This ensures all candidates have a clear understanding of their potential responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Campaigning:</strong> Approved candidates are given a dedicated period to campaign within the community. This allows them to share their goals, proposed initiatives, and vision for their role. Campaigning may include "Meet the Candidates" sessions, presentations, and discussions to engage and inform the community, fostering transparency and trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voting:</strong> The community conducts voting through a secret ballot process to maintain fairness and confidentiality. Voting is open to all eligible members(e.g., junior and senior committees) and can be facilitated in-person or through a secure online platform. This ensures everyone has an equal opportunity to voice their choice for the incoming leaders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Results & Handover:</strong> Once votes are counted and verified, the results are announced in a formal manner. A handover ceremony is held to celebrate the transition of leadership. Outgoing leaders provide mentorship and guidance to the incoming members, ensuring they are well-prepared for their new roles and responsibilities, fostering continuity and growth within the community.

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our community's mission is to build an ecosystem within the campus
            where everyone feels welcome to practice their leadership skills.
            The heart of our community is that senior year students organize
            workshops for junior year students. This approach allows senior
            students to lead events, boosting their confidence, while junior
            students benefit from the knowledge and experience of their seniors.
            An additional benefit for senior year students is that these
            leadership experiences enhance their resumes, making it easier to
            secure internships.
