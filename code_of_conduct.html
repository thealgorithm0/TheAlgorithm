              The Algorithm is dedicated to empowering women in technology. We aim
              to create an inclusive, supportive, and respectful community where
              everyone feels welcome. This Code of Conduct outlines our
              expectations for all members and participants in our community.
            </p>

            <h3>Core Values</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Inclusivity & Diversity</strong>
                We welcome women of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences. 
                By women we mean cisgender, transgender, and non-binary individuals 
                who identify with the female experience. We celebrate diversity 
                in all its forms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Respect & Dignity</strong>
                Treat others with respect and kindness. Every person deserves 
                to be treated with dignity regardless of their background, 
                experience level, or perspective. Discrimination, harassment, 
                or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Empowerment & Growth</strong>
                Support and uplift each other, fostering sisterhood and an 
                environment where everyone can grow and succeed. We believe 
                in collective growth and mutual empowerment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing</strong>
                Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing. Everyone has 
                something valuable to contribute, regardless of their experience 
                level. We learn together and grow together.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integrity & Authenticity</strong>
                Act with honesty and integrity in all interactions. Be 
                authentic, acknowledge mistakes, and commit to continuous 
                learning and improvement.

              To maintain a safe and inclusive environment, we have established 
              clear consequences for violations of this Code of Conduct:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Warning</strong>
                For minor violations, the person will receive a formal warning 
                explaining why their behavior was inappropriate and what is 
                expected of them in the future. This serves as an educational 
                opportunity and a chance for course correction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Temporary Suspension</strong>
                For more serious or repeated violations, the person may be 
                temporarily suspended from community activities and events. 
                The duration will depend on the severity of the violation.
              </li>
              <li>

                permanently expelled from the community. This decision is made 
                carefully and only when necessary.
